Accessibility for the physically disabled is a prevalent issue at UCLA where stairs and steep slopes make navigating campus arduous. In this
project, we aim to model UCLA campus as a network to derive insights about  wheelchair accessible paths. We employ APIs and Depth First Search 
to model campus in a comprehensive network. Using travel time as the primary metric, we develop two algorithms, Dijkstra’s and least-resistance,
to find optimal paths from selected nodes. We highlight crucial nodes of campus using centrality measures. We demonstrate how wheelchair users
are dramatically inconvenienced by the lack of accommodations and inefficient ramps. We seek to expand the model’s scope and improve its accuracy
in addition to proposing engineering solutions to make campus more accessible for the physically disabled.
